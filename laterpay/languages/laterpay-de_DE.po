"                <strong>Setting Prices</strong><br>\n"
"                You can set an individual price for each post.<br>\n"
"                Possible prices are either 0.00 (free) or any value between "
"0.05 (inclusive) and 149.99 (inclusive).<br>\n"
"                If you set an individual price, category default prices you "
"might have set for the post's category(s)\n"
"                won't apply anymore, unless you make the post use a category "
"default price.\n"
"            </p>\n"
"            <p>\n"
"                <strong>Dynamic Pricing Options</strong><br>\n"
"                You can define dynamic price settings for each post to "
"adjust prices automatically over time.<br>\n"
"                <br>\n"
"                For example, you could sell a \"breaking news\" post for "
"0.49 (high interest within the first 24 hours)\n"
"                and automatically reduce the price to 0.05 on the second "
"day.\n"
"            </p>\n"
"            <p>\n"
"                <strong>Teaser</strong><br>\n"
"                The teaser should give your visitors a first impression of "
"the content you want to sell.<br>\n"
"                You don't have to provide a teaser for every single post on "
"your site:<br>\n"
"                by default, the LaterPay plugin uses the first 60 words of "
"each post as teaser content.\n"
"                <br>\n"
"                Nevertheless, we highly recommend manually creating the "
"teaser for each post, to increase your sales.\n"
"            </p>\n"
"            <p>\n"
"                <strong>Pay Later</strong><br>\n"
"                If you choose to sell your content as <strong>Pay Later</"
"strong>, a user pays the purchased content <strong>later</strong>. The "
"purchase is added to his LaterPay invoice and he has to log in to LaterPay "
"and pay, once his invoice has reached 5.00 (EUR or USD).<br>\n"
"                LaterPay <strong>recommends</strong> Pay Later for all "
"prices up to 5.00 as they deliver the <strong>best purchase experience</"
"strong> for your users.<br>\n"
"                PPU is possible for prices between (including) <strong>0.05</"
"strong> and (including) <strong>5.00</strong>.\n"
"            </p>\n"
"            <p>\n"
"                <strong>Pay Now</strong><br>\n"
"                If you sell your content as <strong>Pay Now</strong>, a user "
"has to <strong>log in</strong> to LaterPay and <strong>pay</strong> for your "
"content <strong>immediately</strong>.<br>\n"
"                Pay Now are especially suitable for higher-value content "
"and / or content that immediately occasions costs (e. g. license fees for a "
"video stream).<br>\n"
"                Pay Now are possible for prices between (including) "
"<strong>1.49 € (in Europe) / $ 1.99 (in the U.S.)</strong> and (including) "
"<strong>149.99</strong>.\n"

"time pass should cover and for which period of time it should be valid. A "

"            </ul>\n"
"            <p>\n"
"                The <strong>validity period</strong> of a time pass starts "
"with the <strong>purchase</strong> and is defined for a <strong>continuous</"
"strong> use – i.e. it doesn't matter, if a user is on your website during "
"the entire validity period. After a time pass has expired, the access to the "
"covered content is automatically refused. Please note: Access to pages which "
"are <strong>still open</strong> when a pass expires will be refused only "
"after <strong>reloading</strong> the respective page. <strong>Any files</"
"strong> (images, documents, presentations...), that were downloaded during "
"the validity period, can still be used after the access has expired – but "

"            <p>\n"
"                <strong>Deleting Time Passes</strong><br>\n"

"                When a user purchases a time pass, he has access to all the "
"content covered by this pass during the validity period. Of course, you can "
"still sell your content individually.<br>\n"
"                Example: A user has already purchased the post \"New York – "
"a Travel Report\" for 0.29. Now he purchases a Week Pass for the category "
"\"Travel Reports\" for 0.99. The category also contains the \"New York\" "
"post. For one week, he can now read all posts in the category \"Travel "
"Reports\" for a fixed price of 0.99. After this week, the access expires "
"automatically. During the validity period, the user will not see any "
"LaterPay purchase buttons for posts in the category \"Travel Reports\". "
"After the pass has expired, the user will still have access to the post he "
"had previously purchased individually.\n"
