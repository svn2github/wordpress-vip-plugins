== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I get mobile-apps? =

You simply have to register free at [UppSite.com](http://www.uppsite.com/?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=faq&utm_campaign=plugin-page "http://www.UppSite.com") and install the UppSite Wordpress plugin (this one).

= Is it really FREE?! How come? =

Yes, creating mobile-apps with UppSite.com is free! The mobile-apps created for you are accompanied with small ads shown to your users, which you and UppSite receive revenue over. 

= My blog starts showing XML output since I installed your plugin. Why? =
You are probably using a cache plugin (such as W3 Total Cache or WP Super Cache), but did not add the exception for: MySiteApp.
On your blog, please go to the cache plugin settings, from there to "user-agent" settings, and add the word "MySiteApp" (without quotes) to the user-agent exception list.

= How much time until I have my own native apps? =
Once you finish registering for UppSite (and installing our plugin on the way), you will be requested to apply your website for app creation ("Create My Apps" button on final registration step). After that, your website will be subject to our staff review (which usually takes about 2-3 days), making sure that your website qualifies for all the application-stores your requested to appear on (Apple AppStore and Google Market for instance). After approval, you will be notified by email, and your apps will appear on application stores shortly: for Google Market it takes almost immediately upon UppSite approval, whereas in Apple Appstore it might even take a good two weeks (sadly, it does not depend on us). You will also be notified be email upon appearing on the stores. 

= Why do I need the API key & API secret for UppSite plugin? =
On your blog's Dashboard, you are able to input API key & API secret to the UppSite plugin settings page. This information allows your blog to send Push Notifications to your app users, once they install your blog.

= What happens if I don't supply an API key & API secret? =
Well, nothing actually happens - and that includes your apps will not provide your users Push Notifications. Everything else will be just find, and you will be able to get free native apps with UppSite even so.
You should note though, that Push Notifications are a major feature native apps have over web apps. Disabling it by not providing the API key & secret to plugin settings will reduce intraction users have with your blog.
